📚 MACHINE LEARNING TYPE USED IN YOUR COURSE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM

Your current approach falls under:

🎯 UNSUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING (Content-Based Filtering)

You're using techniques from the field of Recommender Systems, particularly:
- NLP-based embeddings
- Cosine similarity
- Content-based filtering

This is not classification or regression — it's vector-based matching using feature similarity.


🔧 WHAT IS CONTENT-BASED FILTERING?

Definition:
A recommendation approach where we recommend items (courses) to a user (student) based on the similarity between item content and the user’s preferences.

Your system answers:
“What other courses are similar to the ones this student already completed?”


🧩 HOW YOUR SYSTEM WORKS

STEP 1: Course Embeddings
Each course is represented by a feature vector (embedding), based on:
- Course title
- Description
- Tags / keywords

Example:
Course: "Python for Data Science"
Description: "Learn Python, Numpy, Pandas, Visualization, and more."
Embedding: [0.21, 0.48, -0.15, ..., 0.92]

STEP 2: Student Profile Vector
Each student’s profile = average of vectors of completed courses.

If a student took:
- Course A → [0.2, 0.5, -0.1]
- Course B → [0.1, 0.7, 0.0]
Profile vector = [0.15, 0.6, -0.05]

STEP 3: Cosine Similarity
To recommend:
- Compare student profile with every course not completed.
- Use cosine similarity.

Formula:
cos(θ) = (a ⋅ b) / (||a|| * ||b||)

Higher cosine similarity → higher recommendation score


🔍 EXAMPLE

Courses:
Python         [0.1, 0.5]
Data Science   [0.2, 0.6]
Deep Learning  [0.9, 0.1]

Student A took: Python → [0.1, 0.5]
Profile vector = [0.1, 0.5]

Similarity:
Data Science → high similarity ✅
Deep Learning → low similarity ❌

→ Recommend Data Science


🛠️ TOOLS

- Embeddings: Sentence Transformers, OpenAI, TF-IDF
- Similarity: cosine_similarity (sklearn)
- Vector math: numpy, pandas


✅ PROS

- Works with small data
- Handles new courses (cold start)
- Fast & scalable
- Good personalization


❌ LIMITATIONS

- Doesn’t learn from other students
- Can’t recommend dissimilar or surprising courses
- Weak if student has few or no completed courses
